# minecraft-discord-script
I made this script for a specific server I play on and their coinflip bot. This might offer as some guidance to creating something similar for your own use case.

## Disclaimer
This script is for informational/educational purposes only. Gambling may have legal restrictions depending on your location. I am not responsible for any misuse or losses incurred. With that being said, this is for a minecraft server that deals with virtual money.

## Purpose
This script automates interactions with a specific Minecraft server's coinflip bot on Discord. I like playing on this server, and I got too lazy to constantly put the coinflip command, what better than to automate it since they had a discord plugin to do so!

## Setup
1. Obtain your discord's authorization token.
2. Fill in the required Discord IDs 
3. Install dependencies

## Usage
You can probably change this template to automate any type of commands on discord to your specification!
